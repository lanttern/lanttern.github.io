        <div id = "h4", class = "col-md-12">To discover the changes for ten startup industries from 1990 to 2013 each year, a time-series chart (top) was applied. In this chart, the percentages of startups by industry presented dynamic changes, but in general, two dominant industries - software and biotechnology, tend to shrink, and some startups in new industries increased. These changes seem to start from 2000. To explore if these trends are more obvious between two time periods - from 1990 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2013, the second chart (bottom) was applied to compare mean of percentages of startups by industry. Compared with 90s, the percentages of startups in software, biotechnology and consulting decrease obviously. While, the percentages of startups in new emeraged industries including social media, mobile and e-commerce incline to increase.
